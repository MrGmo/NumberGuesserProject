# NumberGuesserProject

Hi there!

This repo contains a simple number guesser game. It was one of my first projects in Javascript, but I'm only now writing a read-me file for it. In this game you need to guess a number from one to ten and you have three opportunities. If you guess correctly the outline of the input will light up green and say you have won. If guess incorrectly you will have three chances total to guess the correct number. If you don't the game will end and you can play the game again.

Link, deployed on netlify: https://number-guesser-app.netlify.app/

Tech used: HTML and JavaScript

Optimizations:

I could have done more with the layout of the game and incorporated other features, maybe even included some CSS. The main objective of building this game was really just getting used to event listeners and a couple Javascript methods like Math.random().

Lessons Learned:

  1. Learned how to pull text from an input.
  2. Learned how to implement event listeners.
  3. Learned how to reset a simple game using Javascript methods.
